	            Congratulations, you are on the best way to improve the management of your Tasks.
	        </p>		
	        <p>        		        		       
	            Visualizing your work is one of the most basic things to improve your efficiency.
	            How can you manage something that is not visible?
	        </p>
	                                
            <p>Here is a list of features that are currently implemented:</p>
            <ul style="margin-left:50px;margin-top:10px;">
                <li>Create boards with a dynamic amount of columns & task limits on them</li>
                <li>Basic user-management (decide who should collaborate with you on the same board)</li>
                <li>Create / Update tasks - all clients that view your board will be updated on the fly (test it out by opening 2 browser instances)</li>
                <li>Marking tasks as blocked</li>
                <li>Basic chat functionality - send chat messages to everyone that looks at the boad (history won't be saved')</li>
                <li>Auto assignment of tasks (whoever pulls a task in your process flow will be the assignee)</li>
                <li>Upload an avatar for your user to easily see who is working on which task</li>
                <li>Experimental: Reporting - Cumulative Flow Diagram, Average Throughput Diagram (will be improved & extended)</li>                    
            </ul>
